    <h1>Beautiful 90's Website dot com</h1>
    <p>This is the product of the <em>Build Your Own 90s Website!</em> workshop 2022.</p>

      <h2>The creation of this website</h2>
      <p style="color: 110000;">I spent most of the time getting the webserver running so I didn't have time to make a pretty website.
      Please enjoy!</p>
      <p style="color: 220000;">Now I'm having trouble with ETags/caching.
      Caching is hard!</p>
      <p style="color: 440000;">No, the error was that I never closed the &lt;title&gt; tag.</p>
      <p style="color: 880000;">This has been a frustrating experience.</p>
